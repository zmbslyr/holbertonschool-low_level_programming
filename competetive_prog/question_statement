You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. For each valid i, the star value of the element Ai is the number of valid indices j<i such that Aj 
is divisible by Ai.Chef is a curious person, so he wants to know the maximum star value in the given sequence. Help him find it.
input:-
The first line of the input contains a single integer T
which denotes the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
.
The second line of each test case contains N
space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output:-
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum star value.
Constraints:-
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤106
for each valid i
Sum of N
over all test cases does not exceed 100,000.
